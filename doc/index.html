<h2 id="label-dotfiles">dotfiles</h2>

<p>Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. The very
prejudiced mix: OS X, zsh, Ruby, Rails, git, homebrew, rvm, vim. If you
match up along most of those lines, you may dig my dotfiles.</p>

<p>I was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about
(which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too). That led to
this project being much more topic-centric. I realized I could split a lot
of things up into the main areas I used (Ruby, git, system libraries, and
so on), so I structured the project accordingly.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these
are awesome, you might want to <a
href="http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/">read
my post on the subject</a>.</p>

<h2 id="label-install">install</h2>
<ul><li>
<p><code>git clone git://github.com/abrausch/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles</code></p>
</li><li>
<p><code>cd ~/.dotfiles</code></p>
</li><li>
<p><code>rake install</code></p>
</li></ul>

<p>The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in
<code>.dotfiles</code> to your home directory. Everything is configured and
tweaked within <code>~/.dotfiles</code>, though.</p>

<p>The main file you&#39;ll want to change right off the bat is
<code>zsh/zshrc.symlink</code>, which sets up a few paths that&#39;ll be
different on your particular machine.</p>

<h2 id="label-topical">topical</h2>

<p>Everything&#39;s built around topic areas. If you&#39;re adding a new area
to your forked dotfiles — say, “Java” — you can simply add a
<code>java</code> directory and put files in there. Anything with an
extension of <code>.zsh</code> will get automatically included into your
shell. Anything with an extension of <code>.symlink</code> will get
symlinked without extension into <code>$HOME</code> when you run <code>rake
install</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-what-27s+inside">what&#39;s inside</h2>

<p>A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file
browser above and see what components may mesh up with you. Fork it, remove
what you don&#39;t use, and build on what you do use.</p>

<h2 id="label-components">components</h2>

<p>There&#39;s a few special files in the hierarchy.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>bin/</strong>: Anything in <code>bin/</code> will get added to your
<code>$PATH</code> and be made  available everywhere.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>topic/*.zsh</strong>: Any files ending in <code>.zsh</code> get
loaded into your  environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>topic/*.symlink</strong>: Any files ending in
<code>*.symlink</code> get symlinked into  your <code>$HOME</code>. This is
so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles  but still keep
those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get  symlinked in when
you run <code>rake install</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>topic/*.completion.sh</strong>: Any files ending in
<code>completion.sh</code> get loaded  last so that they get loaded after
we set up zsh autocomplete functions.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-add-ons">add-ons</h2>

<p>There are a few things I use to make my life awesome. They&#39;re not a
required dependency, but if you install them they&#39;ll make your life a
bit more like a bubble bath.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>If you want some more colors for things like <code>ls</code>, install grc:
<code>brew install   grc</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you install the excellent <a
href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com">rvm</a> to manage  multiple rubies,
your current branch will show up in the prompt. Bonus.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-bugs">bugs</h2>

<p>I want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it
should work for you even though you may not have <code>rvm</code>
installed, for example. That said, I do use this as <em>my</em> dotfiles,
so there&#39;s a good chance I may break something if I forget to make a
check for a dependency.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please <a
href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues">open an issue</a> on this
repository and I&#39;d love to get it fixed for you!</p>

<h2 id="label-thanks">thanks</h2>

<p>I forked <a href="http://github.com/ryanb">Ryan Bates</a>&#39; excellent <a
href="http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> for a couple years
before the weight of my changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my
own. But Ryan&#39;s dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash
customization, and then to jump ship to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of
the code in these dotfiles stem or are inspired from Ryan&#39;s original
project.</p>
